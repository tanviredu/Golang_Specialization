// you can create a variable in the traditional way
// there is a hard way to do that with the help of he memory 
// address

// we use the new() function and pass them the variable type
// like new(int)
// this will give you a memory address of the int
// amd you will store it to a variable with this
// ptr :=  new(int)
// then you put the value in the memory address like the pointer
// *ptr = 3
// sometimes this helps
